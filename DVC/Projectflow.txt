1 Create git repo and clone in local
2 Create code.py and add code to it(it will csv file to new 
"data" folder)
3 Do a git  add commit push before initialization dvc. 
4 pip install dvc
5 How we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore,.dvc)
6 How to do "mkdir s3" (create a new s3 directory)
7 How to do "dvc remote add -d s3" (add s3 as remote)
8 Next "dvc add data/"
  Next it will ask to do: (git rm -r --cached 'data' and "git commit -m "stop tracking data")
  Because initially we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remote it for DVC to handle.
9 Again we do "DVC add data/" (create data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
